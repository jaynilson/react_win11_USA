# Security Policy


## Reporting a Vulnerability
We highly value security for the project.
If you find a security vulnerability in the Win11react project, kindly send a message to any of the **SUPER MODS** on the <a href="https://discord.gg/qmEZwUhb4b"> Discord Server</a> instead of posting a public issue in GitHub.<br>
If you had any minor issues, bugs, or want to share about your experience, feel free to do so on our <a href="https://github.com/blueedgetechno/win11React/discussions"> discussion section</a>. One can also post the the issues in the <a href="https://github.com/blueedgetechno/win11React/issues">issues section of the github repo</a>.

At this juncture, we don't have a bug bounty program. We are a small team trying to solve a big problem. We urge you to report any vulnerabilities responsibly
so that we can continue building a secure application for the entire community.
